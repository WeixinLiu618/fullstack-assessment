## The files that were modified are:

1. `app/page.tsx` - Main product list page (bug fixes)
2. `app/product/page.tsx` - Product detail page (bug fixes)
3. `next.config.ts` - Image configuration (bug fix for Amazon image domains)
4. `README.md` - Documentation of all changes


## Bugs Identified and Fixed

### Bug #1 Security Issue: Product Data in URL

**Location**: `app/page.tsx` line 167-170

**Issue**: The entire product object was being passed through the URL as a JSON-stringified query parameter when navigating to the product detail page.

**Problems**:
- **Security Risk**: All product data exposed in the URL and browser history
- **Data Manipulation**: Users could modify the URL to inject arbitrary product data
- **URL Length Limits**: Could hit browser URL length limitations (typically 2000 characters)
- **Poor UX**: Extremely long, ugly URLs that are not shareable
- **SEO Impact**: Non-semantic URLs hurt search engine optimization


**Fix**: 
1. `app/page.tsx` (Line 167)
* Changed from passing entire product object to passing only the SKU:

```typescript
// Before:
href={{
  pathname: "/product",
  query: { product: JSON.stringify(product) },
}}

// After:
href={`/product?sku=${product.stacklineSku}`}
```

2. `app/product/page.tsx` (Lines 23-90)
* Updated to fetch product data from the API instead of parsing from URL
* Changed from productParam to sku parameter
* Added loading and error states
* Implemented API fetch to /api/products/${sku}
* Added proper error handling
* Added loading state UI
* Added error state UI with user-friendly message

### Bug #2 UX and Functionality Issue: Category & Subcategory Filtering

**Location**: `app/page.tsx` lines 55, 59, 98-132

**Issue**: Multiple related problems with category and subcategory filtering functionality and UX.

**Problems**:
- **Incorrect Filtering**: Subcategories dropdown showed ALL subcategories from ALL categories instead of filtering by selected category
- **No Individual Filter Clearing**: Users could only clear all filters at once, no way to select "All Categories" or "All Subcategories" individually
- **Invalid State Possible**: Users could select subcategories that didn't belong to the selected category
- **State Management**: Subcategory didn't auto-clear when switching categories, causing confusion

**Fix**:
1. **`app/page.tsx`** lines 55, 59, 98-132
* Added category parameter to subcategories API call for proper filtering:

    ```typescript
    // Before:
    fetch(`/api/subcategories`)
    
    // After:
    fetch(`/api/subcategories?category=${encodeURIComponent(selectedCategory)}`)
    ```

* Added auto-clear logic when category changes.
* Added "All Categories" option to category dropdown.
* Added "All Subcategories" option to subcategory dropdown.

### Bug #3 Functionality Issue: No Error Handling on API Calls

**Location**: `app/page.tsx` lines 46, 48-59, 61-79, 81-104, 178-187

**Issue**: None of the fetch calls had any error handling. If any API endpoint failed, the application would break silently.

**Problems**:
- **Silent Failures**: No error messages shown to users when API calls fail
- **Poor UX**: Application appears broken with no feedback or explanation
- **Stuck Loading States**: Loading indicators could remain visible indefinitely
- **No Recovery Option**: Users have no way to retry failed requests
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Only console errors available, not user-friendly

**Fix**:

1. **`app/page.tsx` ** (Line 46, 48-59, 61-79, 81-104, 178-187)
* Added error state management:
   - Added `error` state variable for tracking API failures.
* Added error handling to categories API call with user-friendly error message.
* Added error handling to subcategories API call with graceful degradation.
* Added error handling to products API call with proper state management.
* Added error UI with retry functionality.

### Bug #4 Performance Issue: Search Input Triggers on Every Keystroke

**Location**: `app/page.tsx` lines 39, 49-56, 95, 114

**Issue**: Search functionality triggered an API call on every single keystroke, causing excessive API requests.

**Problems**:
- **Excessive API Calls**: Typing "laptop" creates 6 API calls (one for each character: l, la, lap, lapt, lapto, laptop)
- **Server Overhead**: Wastes server resources processing intermediate/incomplete search queries
- **Poor Performance**: Rapid loading state changes create flickering UI
- **Potential Rate Limiting**: Could hit API rate limits with fast typing
- **Network Waste**: Unnecessary bandwidth usage for queries user didn't intend to search

**Fix**:

1. **`app/page.tsx`** lines 39, 49-56, 95, 114
* Added debounced search state:
   ```typescript
   const [debouncedSearch, setDebouncedSearch] = useState("");
   ```
* Implemented debounce logic with 300ms delay.
* Changed products API call to use debounced value.

### Additional Fix: Next.js Image Configuration

**Location**: `next.config.ts` lines 10-13

**Issue**: Product images from Amazon CDN were failing to load with error: "hostname is not configured under images in your next.config.js"


**Fix**:

**`next.config.ts` (Lines 10-13)**
Added Amazon image domain to Next.js remote patternsï¼š
```
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'm.media-amazon.com',
      },
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
